### More Bandits, testing version
 For C:BN. Adds a lot more spawning locations for small groups of bandits making them much more frequent. All code ~~stolen~~ extracted from No_Hope mod by Night_Pryanik.
 This mod adds few new map_extras that spawn small groups of bandits. After some testing I plan to make two versions, Sane with spawn frequency as is and Hardcore where seeing zombies will make you feel safe.
 Later possibly other iterations with more variety of bandits like mutated bandits, techno bandits, trans bandits or magic bandits for Arcana.
 
 Safe to add midgame. It will spawn bandits in unexplored areas.
